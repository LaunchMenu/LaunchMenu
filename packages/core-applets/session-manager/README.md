# Session manager

Multiple session can be started in LaunchMenu, in order to keep some state while performing a new search. This is comparable to how internet browsers allow you to open multiple tabs.

The session can be accessed in the global section of the context menu.
Here sessions can be added and removed, and opened.

## Planned

Some more functionality is planned, but not implemented yet:

-   Rename sessions
-   Color label sessions
-   Allow to create default sessions, that automatically start up?
