# Settings manager

LaunchMenu has default settings as well as settings for every applet. The settings manager can be used to change the values of these settings.

In order to search for a specific setting, use the prefix: `s:`, E.g.: `s:down`. In addition, the settings of a specific applet can be browsed by opening the settings applet.

## Planned

Some more functionality is planned, but not implemented yet:

-   Importing/exporting settings, in order to share them
    -   This should be a combined export (not a separate file for each applet)
-   Add settings templates system:
    -   Allow the user to create a collection of setting values
    -   Allow the user to specify a shortcut to activate the collection
    -   Allow the option of toggling between 2 collections with 1 shortcut
