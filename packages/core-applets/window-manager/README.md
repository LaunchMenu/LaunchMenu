# Window manager

The window manager applet can be used to:

-   Position the window
-   Resize the window
-   Control automatic startup
-   Control window opening/closing
-   Create a tray icon

## Planned

Currently the automatic startup only support windows, and requires elevation. Support for Mac and Linux is also planned, as well as a non-elevated version.
