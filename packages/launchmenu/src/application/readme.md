This directory contains the 'global' aspects that are really specific to the framework, rather than utilities that Applets can use.

The contents outside of this directory can be considered general utilities that have a larger chance of being used in an applet. Anything both inside and outside of this directory may be used for whatever purpose however, it's just a lose rule of thumb to improve structuring.
