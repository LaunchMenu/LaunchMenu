## Roadmap

The exact features of this applet have yet to be determined, but it will generally just provide simple quick search results.

In general, a lot more planning will have to be done for this applet.

### API

This could be accomplishable with [DuckduckGo's instant answer API](https://duckduckgo.com/api). More extensive searches would also be cool, but might be hard to achieve without relying on an API that requires credentials (which is hard to achiever with LM since we don't have a private back-end).
