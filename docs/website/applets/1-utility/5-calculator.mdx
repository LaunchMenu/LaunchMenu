# Calculator

<StatusNotice />

## Roadmap

The exact features of this applet have yet to be determined, but it will provide some calculator functionalities.

### MVP

As an MVP, it could just provide answers for simple calculations such as

```
5 + 9 * sin(3.4) =
```

When such a query is entered, a menu item with the result could appear in the menu.

### Advanced

There is a lot more advanced functionality that could be added to a calculator applet like this. Some ideas are deescribed below.

#### Plotting

It could provide simple plotting capabilities, for formulas involving 1 variable such as:

```
x + 9 * sin(x) =
```

in which case we also have to consider how the plot result will be nevigated (translation + zoom)

This idea could even be taken a step further by making an environment simular to the one found in [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). This would obviously be a large undertaking however. When making such an advanced system you would probably also want to be able to save the environment and such.

#### Derivatives/integrals

The calculator may provide some way of calculating derivatives and integrals including their derivation steps, similar to [derivative-calculator.net](https://www.derivative-calculator.net/) and [integral-calculator.net](https://www.integral-calculator.net/).

#### Wolfram alpha

Depending on available apis, it would be amazing if a service similar to [wolfram alpha](#https://www.wolframalpha.com/) could provide some advanced analytical data that wouldn't be feasible for us to implement in javascript.
