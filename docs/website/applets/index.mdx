# Applets

LaunchMenu is nothing without its applets.

Applets are divided into 2 primary categories:

-   Utility: Applets which provide services to the user
-   Core: Applets that exist to customize and control aspects of LaunchMenu

### Official LaunchMenu Applets

There isn't a large collection of applets yet but we have some ideas for useful ones. If you want to contribute to any of these feel free to contact us and discuss your ideas, either the following social media:

-   [Element](https://app.element.io/#/room/#launchmenu:matrix.org)
-   [GitHub discussionski ](http://github.com/LaunchMenu/LaunchMenu/discussions/categories/general)

### 3rd party applets

In the (hopefully near) future our applet-manager core applet will also support installation of applets. Any 3rd party can simply publish their applet on npm, and users will be able to search for them and install them directly.
