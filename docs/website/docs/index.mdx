# Docs

Currently no real API documentation exists yet, but instead we've created some guides and explanations covering different aspects of LaunchMenu. The docs consist of the following parts:

-   [Guide](/docs/guide/1.-overview): A step by step guide to create a basic applet
-   [Concepts](/docs/concepts): Explanations about different aspects of LaunchMenu
-   [API overview](/docs/api-overview): A list of different useful building blocks available in LaunchMenu
