### Goal

LaunchMenu is an open source utility application similar to LaunchBar and Spotlight for Mac.

The aim, to bring all important utilities (applets) to your fingertips. For us having utilities quickly accessable via the keyboard is vital, however we will also support usage of the mouse.

LaunchMenu runs in the background. Upon pressing `⌘ + space`/`⊞ + space` a menu opens allowing you to type a query. Queries are used to open different applets.

Contact us if you want to contribute to the project. We are currently looking for a designer to improve this look:

### Functionality

We have planned the following applet so far:

-   File search
-   Dictionary
-   Translator
-   Calculator
-   Time tracker (Similar to [toggl](https://toggl.com/))

### Current state

Currently we are working on the Core Framework of LaunchMenu which you can read about in our other repository: [Adjust](https://github.com/LaunchMenu/Adjust)
The information within this readme regarding the framework is outdated. We will try to update this file with appropriate information in the near future.

### RoadMap

    * Create the ability to make workspaces for LaunchMenu.
    * Create demo/test applet (E.G. note maker).
    * Common UI controls.
