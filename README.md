### Goal

LaunchMenu is an open source utility application similar to LaunchBar and Spotlight for Mac.

The aim, to bring all important utilities (applets) to your fingertips. For us having utilities quickly accessable via the keyboard is vital, however we will also support usage of the mouse.

LaunchMenu runs in the background. Upon pressing `⌘ + space`/`⊞ + space` a menu opens allowing you to type a query. Queries are used to open different applets.

Contact us if you want to contribute to the project. We are currently looking for a designer to improve this look:

### Functionality

We have planned the following applet so far:

-   File search
-   Dictionary
-   Translator
-   Calculator
-   Time tracker (Similar to [toggl](https://toggl.com/))

### Current state

At this point LaunchMenu is mostly feature complete. Most core functionality and core-applets have been written and integrated into LaunchMenu.

A [quick-start applet](https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LM-applet-quickstart) has been created, to help devs create new applets.

### Next Steps

* Build some simple applets to test functionality with.
    * Note tracker
    * Wiki search
* FileSearch applet.
* Release Version 1.0.0
* ???
* Profit.
